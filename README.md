# ProcessingMavenExample
An example project showing how to use maven + processing + a conversion script
Run ./toPde.sh to convert from java to a processing sketch. Use the generated zip folder as your processing sketchbook.
For linux, bash should be able to run toPde.sh
On windows, install a bash shell like cygwin, and make sure to install zip for it.

Once you generate the processing files, a zip file is spat out that you can upload straight to the vic uploader.
